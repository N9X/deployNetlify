These companies generally have a market cap of below 100 Crore.</p><p>These organizations are listed just to show their online presence, they do not actually have anything behind them. There is no actual business taking place, you check their P&amp;L or Balance sheet and you will find no business happening in it.

It depends on your total investing capacity and the number of units you are acquiring of any particular stock. Getting the correct position of a stock is important to ensure your stay in the market for the long run.</p><p>Your holding capacity increases for the long term when you have control over your investment.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>If you’ve invested all of your money in a single stock, you won’t be able to enjoy its entire gain even if the stock gives you a 200% gain, you’ll constantly feel the need to sell it off and recover your money+gain from that investment. If there are chances of that stock going higher, your subconsciousness might force you to move immediately. In another scenario, if your investment is down by 50% you will worry the entire time for your stock to go high so that you can at least recover your initial investment.</p><p>The concept of correct position sizing is fundamental for any sort of investment. The most extraordinary gains are made in the market in less than 1% of days, but the catch is that we don’t know what that 1% of days are, so staying invested for a long term can work in our benefit, and to stay invested for a long term holding the right position sizing is important. It may happen that in many cases holding the right position size can be more important than the selection of stock.</p><p><strong>(The table made by Raj/Yaman will be used here)</strong></p><p>Here you can see there are four different parameters that take place when you are investing. Namely your position in the stock, volatility of your portfolio, the impact of fear &amp; greed, and your holding capacity. The importance of every parameter cannot be overstated. Whenever one portfolio starts to increase, the rest three start to change as well. A 2% allocation to an investment won’t show any big return on your overall portfolio, while a 100% allocation to only one stock will make your entire portfolio volatile and decrease your holding capacity, not to mention the sleepless nights due to fear. You must find the right balance to work out your holding capacity that also keeps your fear &amp; greed in control.</p><p>Use the position sizing tool to ensure you are in the right position.
